### Preview changes locally

If you're developing or doing many content edits, it's best to serve locally.

A. Build changes with Jekyll:
  - `jekyll build --watch`

Or B. Live push changes to your browser with Browsersync:
  - Run the Jekyll command above
  - `npm install`
  - `gulp` (if Jekyll errors, then try `sudo gulp`)
